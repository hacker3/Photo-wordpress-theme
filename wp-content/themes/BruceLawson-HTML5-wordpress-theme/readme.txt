Small print:

- I’m no PHP coder, so it isn’t pretty
- There’s no copyright (the only copyright stuff in this design are the logo and background images which   aren’t in the download)
- I may change it at any time after feedback
- It’s packaged “as is”, although I’ve noted where it requires a certain plug-in
- It’s for educational purposes only; I make no guarantees for it and will not support it
- If you can improve it, please tell me and I’ll replace it with yours! My domain is   www.brucelawson.co.uk, I'm Bruce. You can contact me at my domain.
